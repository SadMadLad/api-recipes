# API Recipes

This is a small yet ambitious project. It is to showcase how you can write APIs using different languages and frameworks.

### Tasks

Each API folder is going to have the following capabilities:

* Store data of a user in an `sqlite3` database locally. Each API will connect with the same `sqlite3` table.
* Perform CRUD on a users table. The attributes of a user include:
  * Name
  * Age
  * Date of Birth
  * Nationality
  * Programming Language

On the way, we will learn how to set up the APIs, use them for basic CRUD, and how to use SQLite3 in different programming languages.
